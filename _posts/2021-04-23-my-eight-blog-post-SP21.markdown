<h1>Setting up MSI Afterburner and RTSS</h1>
<p>This week I wanted to find out if a game I was having fps drops in was being held back by my CPU or graphics card. Through my research I found that MSI Afterburner was the best solution because it comes packaged with a monitoring application called RTSS (RivaTunerStatisticsServer). This application creates an on screen display over your games and can tell you information about your hardware usage such as temperatures and utilization percentage.</p>

<p>Visit this site, https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards, and click the Download Afterburner button. Then once you finish the installer and the software opens click the cog icon to open the settings screen. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCFVt5c.png" width="650" height="300"> <br> Click the Monitoring tab and this is where you select what information you want to be displayed on your screen. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HkUoKE4.png" width="400" height="650"> <br> Whatever information you want to display just click which one you want and click "Show in On-Screen Display".</p>

<p>Next go to the On-Screen Display tab and click the box next to "Toggle On-Screen Display", this is where you pick what button will turn on and off the display such as "F11" which is what I chose. The next step is to open RTSS and turn on "Start With Windows" and "Show On-Screen Display" so that you won't have to open the application every time you turned on your PC and the on-screen display will display on your games. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yk1vJBy.png" width="400" height="650"> <br> There also options you may want to change such as the font type, color of the display color, and the location of the display on your game.</p>

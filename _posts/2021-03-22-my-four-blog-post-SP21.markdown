<h1>Updating Device Drivers on Windows 10</h1>
<p>I recently purchased a new Xbox controller for gaming on my PC. I was planning on connecting it to my PC wirelessly via Bluetooth, but when it was connected, there was constant issues such as the controller inputs not being detected or rapidly repeating on they're own. After some research I found that a solution was to update my PC's Bluetooth device driver. This isn't something that I don't usually bother with since Windows usually has a stable driver version installed on a fresh OS install.</p>

<p>In order to find the devices connected to your PC either internally or externally, you need to find the device manager, which is pretty simple to do. Just search "device manager" in the Windows search bar or right-click the Start button to find there as well. I found my Bluetooth device by simply opening up the section labeled "Bluetooth". From there you right-click the device and click "Update driver" <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XNLhZHZ.png" width="540" height="460"> <br> Next click "Search automatically for drivers" and Windows will search your PC for drivers downloaded to your PC via Windows Updates.</p>

<p>In my experience, this method usually will not result in an update happening, and you'll most likely see a message saying Windows couldn't find a better driver than the one currently installed. As I said before, Windows will use a stable version of a device's driver probably because It's a version that works for the vast majority of users, and constant updates will probably cause compatibility issues for those users as everyone will have varying applications and hardware installed. A last ditch effort you can do is to visit the webpage of the motherboard you have installed and view the downloads section to find more updated drivers that fix niche issues specific to your motherboard. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LwUKkKU.png" width="650" height="300"> <br></p>

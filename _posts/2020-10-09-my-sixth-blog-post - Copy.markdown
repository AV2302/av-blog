<h1>Presentation on IoT Botnets</h1>
<p>For my CIT 425 class, I was in a group that presented on the topic of IoT Botnets. An IoT (Internet of Things) device is one that is connected to the internet to perform a function, such as a smart tv, printer, or security camera. A botnet is when a group of devices is unknowingly running a malicious software that can use the device to perform cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Usually computers are used in botnets, but there is a specific software called Mirai Malware that doesn't actually target computers, but instead targets IoT devices such as the ones I listed previously. The infected devices will continuously scan the internet for IoT devices that are running Linux. This is because those devices use a common set of manufacturer usernames and passwords. There is one specific IoT Botnet attack that I was tasked with researching and presenting.</p>

<p> In 2016, the DNS (Domain Name System) provider "Dyn" was targeted for a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack. A hacker group had over ten-million devices infected with the Mirai Malware and used them to make requests to Dyn's DNS. This overloaded the DNS with so many requests that it became incapable of completing any. This caused connection issues on numerous large websites such as Amazon, CNN, and Reddit. As of today there are three individuals facing charges for the attack.</p>

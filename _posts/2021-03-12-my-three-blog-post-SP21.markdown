<h1>Benchmarking a Newly Built PC</h1>
<p>I have experience putting together computers, as I have built every computer I've owned over the years, because just until recently it was always more economical to buy the parts separately and put them together yourself instead of buying a pre-built one from retailers. I have also built computers for my friends, but before I let them have it, I always benchmark it to make sure everything is functioning correctly. Benchmarking pc components means to run them through tests and compare the results to the manufacturer's claimed performance.</p>

<p>The first component I usually test is the CPU. I use the tool called Prime95 to run a stress test on the CPU so I can see if it can handle a heavy load at a good speed and without overheating. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4zArU6B.png" width="540" height="460"> <br> This is the screen you get when you select the stress test option. Just enter the number threads the CPU has and select the "Blend (all of the above)" option. Once you hit "OK" all cores will be 100% utilized and at that point just let the tool run for 40 minutes to an hour, and if there aren't any crashes then you know the CPU is working fine.</p>

<p>Next component to test is the GPU which is pretty simple. There are games that have a built in benchmark tool and I happen to own two games that do, Far Cry 5 and Rise of the Tomb Raider. You can select a preset such as High or Ultra depending on how you expect your GPU to run the game, then run the Benchmarking tool. This is the benchmark tool for Far Cry - <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DWxR2aJ.png" width="650" height="300"> <br> And the tool for Tomb Raider - <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BTSTfRf.png" width="650" height="300"> <br> Both tools will give you an average FPS (Frames Per Second), where anything above 60fps means the game will run smoothly and anything under 60fps means the GPU can't handle the game at a high graphic setting and you'll have to lower the preset to medium or low. With both the CPU and GPU tested, the other components such as the RAM and PSU will most likely not be an issue, as the stress tests on the first two components were also partly tests on the rest of the components.</p>

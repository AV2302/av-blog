<h1>UX Design and Prototyping</h1>
<p>In my COMP 485 class, Human-Computer Interaction, My group and I were assigned to create a design and prototype for our final project. Our project is a mobile app that will allow the user to create a budget and take pictures of receipts to keep track of expenses. For the design, we were instructed to make sure the design was aesthetically pleasing in a way that elicits positive emotions. A design that leaves a good emotional impact with the users is timless. </p>

<p>A good example of this is the website for the 1996 movie Space Jam, which is still being hosted and has the same design as when it was first made. There have numerous articles about this site and the majority opinion is that the website still looks good. Our attempt at the design was probably not all that emotionally impactful as we wanted for a budgeting app, but for amateurs in design I feel we did the best we could. We even made our icon a very friendly looking piggy bank.</p>

<p>For the prototype, we ended up making one that was low fidelity, and one that was high fidelity. The fidelity of the prototype is how much detail and interactivity there is. Our first prototype was a simple set of wireframes, each showing how a process is happening step by step with very simple diagrams. When we finished with the wireframes, we worked on the high fidelity prototype which is an almost full mockup of the app using software called Adobe XD, which is specifically used as a collaboration tool to design UI and UX. Using Adobe XD we were able to make an almost fully interactive demo of our app.</p>

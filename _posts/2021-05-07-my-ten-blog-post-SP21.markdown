<h1>Troubleshooting an AIO Cooler</h1>
<p>For the past few days I've been hearing a strange sound in my room, but because I'm usually wearing a headset it's faint and I've been ignoring it. Then yesterday I was using my PC without a headset and I could the strange noise was coming from my PC. Upon closer inspection it seemed that the noise was coming from my AIO (all-in-one) cooler. an AIO cooler is a water cooling solution for CPUs that offers lower temperatures and noise levels than standard CPU fan coolers.</p>

<p>The noise that was coming from my cooler was a sort of grinding or rattling sound that has never happened before. After asking for assistance on various internet forums, I was given a couple solutions. The first was to try remounting the fans on the radiator. The radiator is where the water travels to be cooled by the mounted fans. The advice I was given was to make sure the fans were properly screwed in straight and also not too tight, since that might be what is causing the rattling noise.</p>

<p>I wanted to be sure the noise would go away so I tried following the next solution before I tested to see if the first one worked. This usually isn't how I go about troubleshooting PC fixes but I was anxious to get this fixed. This solution was to make sure the mounting orientation of the cooler was correct. Every AIO cooler comes with a pump that makes contact with the CPU, and that pump is connected to the radiator with two hoses. In every AIO cooler there is a bit of air in the loop that can get trapped in the pump if the pump is located at a higher point than the radiator. It turns out that my cooler's setup was exactly like this, so I adjusted the location of the radiator to be mounted on the top of my PC above the pump. Once I put everything together again and started using my PC I have not heard the noise since.</p>

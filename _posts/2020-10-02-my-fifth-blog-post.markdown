<h1>Making a Website</h1>
<p>For my CIT 384 class, we were assigned to create a website that would have at least 4 pages and would made using HTML and CSS. The website could be on anything that we were interested in so I ended up making a site that gave an overview on the history of Esports. Another caveat of this assignment was that we had to use 3 unique HTML element tags and 3 unique attribute tags. Unique meaning that everyone in the class had to have their own tags to use.</p>

<p>I ended up choosing the three element tags &lt;template&gt;, &lt;ins&gt;, and &lt;del&gt;; and the attribute tags I used were autocapitalize, cursor, and inputmode. A quick over on my tags; &lt;template&gt; allows you to hold html that is not used until you use a script to run render that html, so you can keep content hidden until you click a button; &lt;del&gt will create a strikethrough through words to show outdated or incorrect info; &lt;ins&gt; is used in conjuction with &lt;del&gt; to show what the updated or correct info should be.</p>

<p>For the attributes; cursor allows you to change what the cursor icon when hovering over certain content; autocapitalize can make a word, or every word in a sentence capitalized; inputmode is used to specify what content is being entered by the user, this helps users on mobile so the device will know what keyboard to show them such as all numbers or the @ symbol for email. Some of my elements and tags were useful for making a "Contact Us" form so that's where I ended up using &lt;template&gt, autocapitalize, and inputmode. For &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt I purposefly added some outdated info on an Esports competition that was scheduled in August, but was cancelled because of Covid-19. Finally I used cursor to change the look of the cursor when hovering over my navigation links.</p>

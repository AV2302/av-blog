<h1>Setting Up Wake-On-LAN for Windows 10</h1>
<p>On my PC, I run a media server using an app called Plex so that I can watch all of my local media, such as movies and shows, on any smart-tv in my house that supports Plex. I don't have my PC running at all times because I don't use the Plex server often, so when I do want to watch something, for example downstairs, I would have to go up and turn on my PC to have the server running. Due to my own laziness I decided to research how I could remotely power on my PC.</p>

<p>Through my research, I discovered that there is a feature that Windows has had for a long time apparently called "Wake-On-LAN". This feature allows a computer, that is in a low power state, to wait for a "magic packet" that is sent by your router to the PC. Once that packet is received, the PC will power on. I wasn't aware just how many steps it took to enable this feature. <br> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AKSFCgi.jpeg" width="600" height="300"> <br> I thought just by enabling Wake on LAN in my bios that it would just work, but there was more to it than that.</p>
